Creating a GitHub page involves creating a repository on GitHub and adding relevant documentation. Below is a simple template for a GitHub page for an attendance system that uses Raspberry Pi 4, RFID, camera, and SMTP. Please note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to customize it based on your project structure and requirements.

### Project Title: Raspberry Pi Attendance System

#### Overview

This project is an Attendance System built using Raspberry Pi 4, RFID technology, a camera for facial recognition, and SMTP for email notifications.

#### Features

- RFID-based user identification
- Facial recognition using the Raspberry Pi camera
- Real-time attendance tracking
- Email notifications using SMTP

#### Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4
- RFID reader
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- Internet connectivity for SMTP email notifications

#### Software Requirements

- Raspbian OS
- Python 3
- OpenCV for facial recognition
- RFID library (e.g., MFRC522)
- SMTP library for email notifications

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Raspbian OS**: Follow the official Raspberry Pi documentation to install Raspbian on your Raspberry Pi 4.

2. **Connect Hardware Components**: Connect the RFID reader and Raspberry Pi camera to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python libraries and packages using the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3
   sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
   # Install other required libraries
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your Raspberry Pi:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Perceus64/Attendance-System.git
   ```

5. **Configuration**: Modify the configuration file to set up SMTP credentials, users.csv path, camera settings, etc.

6. **Run the System**: Execute the main Python script to start the attendance system:

   ```bash
   cd attendance-system
   python3 IoT_Project.py
   ```
